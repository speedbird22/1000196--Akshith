            "**Outfit Idea:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Top:** A jewel-toned velvet or silk top with interesting details like a ruffle neck, puffed sleeves, or embellished neckline.  Colors like emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, or deep purple work beautifully for the holidays and draw the eye upwards.  Alternatively, a festive patterned top with a darker background and brighter accents can also work well.  The key is to add volume and visual interest to the upper body.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Bottom:**  Dark-colored, tailored trousers or a sleek, A-line midi skirt in a heavier fabric like wool or gabardine.  Black, navy, or deep charcoal grey are slimming and elegant. Avoid clingy fabrics or overly embellished bottoms.  If choosing a skirt, ensure it skims over the hips and doesn't cling.  A midi length is both flattering and appropriate for a formal occasion.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Outerwear (optional):** A structured blazer or a fitted coat in a complementary color or a neutral like black or camel. A slightly longer blazer that falls below the hips can help create a balanced silhouette.\n",

            "**Accessories:**\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Shoes:** Heels or pointed-toe flats in a coordinating color. Heels can elongate the legs and add a touch of formality.  If choosing flats, ensure they have a pointed or slightly elongated toe to maintain a streamlined appearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Bag:** A clutch or a small shoulder bag in a metallic or jewel tone.  A structured bag complements the formal look.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Other:** A festive belt cinched at the natural waist can help define the waistline and create a balanced silhouette, especially if wearing a top that isn't already fitted.\n",

            "    * **Top:**  A brightly colored, loose-fit linen button-down shirt.  Think coral, turquoise, sunny yellow, or a vibrant lime green.  Leave it unbuttoned over the tank or tie it at the waist for a more fitted silhouette.\n",
            "    * **Inner Layer (Optional):** A simple white or cream cotton tank top or bralette for coverage.\n",
            "    * **Bottom:**  High-waisted, wide-leg linen pants in a neutral color like white, beige, or a light khaki. This balances the bright top and provides a breezy, comfortable feel.  Alternatively, a flowy midi skirt in a similar color palette would also work beautifully.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Colors:**  The focus is on a vibrant top, complemented by neutral bottoms.  Consider a monochromatic approach for the pants/skirt and shoes to create a streamlined, modern look.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Fabrics:** Linen is ideal for a summer picnic ‚Äì it's breathable, lightweight, and drapes well. Cotton is another excellent option, especially for the inner layer.\n",

            "* **Accessories:**\n",
            "    * **Shoes:**  White canvas sneakers, espadrilles, or flat sandals.\n",
            "    * **Bag:** A woven tote bag or a crossbody bag in a natural material like straw or canvas.  Choose a color that complements the top or bottoms.\n",
            "    * **Jewelry:** Keep it minimal with delicate gold necklaces or some colorful beaded bracelets.\n",
            "    * **Sunglasses:**  Essential for a sunny picnic! Choose a style that complements your face shape.\n",
            "    * **Hat:** A wide-brimmed straw hat provides shade and adds a touch of chic.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Example Outfit Combination:**  A turquoise linen button-down shirt, a white cotton tank top, white wide-leg linen pants, white canvas sneakers, a woven straw tote bag, delicate gold necklace, and aviator sunglasses.\n",

            "This combination offers comfort, style, and practicality for a summer picnic. The loose fit and breathable fabrics will keep the wearer cool, while the bright colors and modern silhouette reflect their personal style.\n",
